# stroke_simulator_2000
A really simple, stupid program that spits out the result of a ton of processes reading a file. I do a pseudorandom delay
to have a bit of an aesthetic effect to it.

compatibility:
Anything that has a posix-like c environment.

to build:
make 

to run:
./stroke

The define constant READ_FILE is the input file, which by default is the LICENSE file in the pwd. 
I was too lazy to do argument processing.
